  `The House of Lord's digital exclusion inquiry rang alarm bells - but
  the Government's response fell flat. Our Group CEO, Helen Milner OBE, wrote about our 
  disappointment at the lack of promised action.`,
  `We've developed a comprehensive service for digitally excluded people.
  An offer which any local organisation - anywhere in the UK - can use to 
  Fix the Digital Divide in their communities.`,
  `We're calling for the Government to act on digital inclusion with
  three clear policy asks: co-invest to help more digitally excluded 
  people, scrap broadband VAT, and reuse tech for social good.`
